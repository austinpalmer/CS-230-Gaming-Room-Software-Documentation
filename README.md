# The-Gaming-Room-Software-Documentation

# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room is a client who wanted expertise on recommended software and hardware to run their game: Draw It or Lose It. In this multiplayer game, players have unique user identification to login and compete with other players to guess images drawn by another player. Whoever gets the correct answer first wins the round. The Gaming Room needed help with expanding their game to other platforms and using a client-server model to help achieve this goal.

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
One aspect I did particularly good in was analyzing different operating systems and comparing their advantages/disadvantages. This took quite a bit of outside research but it turned out well and taught me a lot in determining what operating systems are best at certain tasks.

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I like the structure to designing this document; it was easy to understand the needs and requirements of the client and laying out the whole process. Additionally, it helped me focus on the business side of software development.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would most likely edit/add-on to the recommendations portion. Although a lot of effort and research was done to determine the best choice for the operating system, more research, particulary about MacOS, would have helped in strengthining my case and showing me what advantages other operating systems besides Windows may have.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Every step of the way required thought of how a user would interact with this software. The main consideration for user experience for me was by deciding to use Windows instead of Linux due to the easier GUI and help accessibility. It is essential that a user's needs are considered as if you design software that isn't user friendly it will be unusable and users will move on to a product that meets their needs. 

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
First, I identified the scope and classes. From what I have learned, I can use design patterns to help the flow of the design process.
